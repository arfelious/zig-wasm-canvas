## Interactive Canvas with Zig
This project is a demonstration for utilizing shared memory access with WebAssembly to create canvas animations using Zig.

You can access the live, up-to-date animations [here](https://matema.tk/interaktif)

The project intends to allow extendability and reusability, so the glue code can be used in different projects with minimal changes.
